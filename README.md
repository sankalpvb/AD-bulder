   ```

2. **Download the Project ZIP**:

   Alternatively, download the ZIP file of the project:
   - Go to the **RS Builder** repository on GitHub.
   - Click the **Code** button, then select **Download ZIP**.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.

### **Step 2: Set Up the Database**

1. **Import the Database**:

   Inside the project folder, you will find a file named `resume_builder.sql` (or similar), which contains the necessary SQL queries to set up the database.

   - Using **phpMyAdmin**:
     - Open phpMyAdmin, create a new database (e.g., `resume_builder`).
     - Select the newly created database, go to the **Import** tab, and choose the `resume_builder.sql` file.
     - Click **Go** to import the database.

   - Using **MySQL Command Line**:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     CREATE DATABASE resume_builder;
     USE resume_builder;
     SOURCE /path/to/your/resume_builder.sql;
     ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**:

   Open the `config.php` file and update the database connection details:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost'); // Database host
   define('DB_USER', 'your-username'); // Database username
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your-password'); // Database password
   define('DB_NAME', 'resume_builder'); // Database name
   ```

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Local Server**

1. **Using XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP**:

   If you're using **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **MAMP**, place the project folder (e.g., `rs-builder`) in the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or equivalent for other platforms.

2. **Using Custom PHP Server**:

   If you're using a custom PHP server, make sure it's configured to serve the project folder as the root directory.

### **Step 4: Run the Application**

1. Start your local development server (Apache, Nginx, etc.).
   - For **XAMPP/WAMP**, open the control panel and start Apache and MySQL.
   - For **MAMP**, start the servers via the MAMP interface.

2. Open your browser and visit the following URL:
   ```
   http://localhost/rs-builder
   ```

   This will open the **RS Builder** homepage where you can start creating your resumes.

### **Step 5: Customize and Use the Application**

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Depending on the system's setup, you may need to create an account or log in to start building resumes.
   
2. **Create a Resume**: Enter your personal details, work experience, education, skills, etc., in the designated fields.

3. **Download Resume**: After creating the resume, you can download it in PDF, DOCX, or other supported formats.

## **Troubleshooting**
