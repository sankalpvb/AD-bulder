RS Builder - Resume Builder Project
Description
RS Builder is a simple and user-friendly Resume Builder application built with PHP. This application allows users to create, customize, and download their resumes in various formats like PDF and Word. The project simplifies the traditionally time-consuming task of resume building by offering professional templates, easy customization, and the option to download resumes for job applications.

Setup and Installation
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the RS Builder PHP project locally.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

PHP (version 7.0 or higher)
MySQL (for database)
Apache or Nginx (for serving PHP)
Composer (optional, for managing PHP dependencies)
Step 1: Download the Project
Clone the Repository:

To clone the repository, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rs-builder.git
Download the Project ZIP:

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the project from the GitHub repository.

Go to the RS Builder repository on GitHub.
Click on the Code button, then select Download ZIP.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.
Step 2: Set Up the Database
Import the Database:

Inside the project folder, you will find a file named resume_builder.sql (or similar). This file contains the SQL queries needed to set up the database.

Import the SQL file into your MySQL server using a MySQL client like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or via the command line:

Using phpMyAdmin:

Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database (e.g., resume_builder).
Select the new database, go to the Import tab, and choose the resume_builder.sql file.
Click Go to import the database.
Using MySQL Command Line:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE resume_builder;
USE resume_builder;
SOURCE /path/to/your/resume_builder.sql;
Configure Database Connection:

Open the config.php file (or the file that contains your database configuration) and update the following details:

php
Copy code
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');  // Database host
define('DB_USER', 'your-username');  // Database username
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your-password');  // Database password
define('DB_NAME', 'resume_builder');  // Database name
Step 3: Set Up Your Local Server
Using XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP:

If you're using XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, place the project folder (e.g., rs-builder) in the htdocs directory for XAMPP (or equivalent for other platforms).
Using Custom PHP Server:

If you're using a custom PHP server, make sure the server is set to point to the project folder as the root directory.
Step 4: Run the Application
Start your local development server (Apache, Nginx, etc.).

If using XAMPP/WAMP, open the control panel and start Apache and MySQL.
If using MAMP, start the servers through the MAMP interface.
Open your browser and go to the following URL:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost/rs-builder
This should open the RS Builder homepage, where you can start creating resumes.

Step 5: Customize and Use the Application
Sign Up / Log In: Depending on how the application is set up, you may need to create an account or log in to start building resumes.

Create a Resume: Enter your details such as name, contact information, work experience, education, etc.
